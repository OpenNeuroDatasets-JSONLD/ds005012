## Data notes
Converted with mids2bids
First, preprocessing notes:
	Discarded values for physio: Per Krisanne Litinas at the University of Michigan MRI lab, the MB fMRI protocol collects a 30 second buffer period plus  12 discarged volumes (9.6 seconds). So the physio files contained in each subject's ./func folder have the first 30 seconds (buffer period) + 9.6 (12 additional volumes for calibration) that are already discarded. Hence, the start time in physio files is zero. The calculation used: retained all values after ({30 secs physio buffer} + {9.6 secs calibration vols}) * {Hz}. For example, Hz for respiratory is 25 and Hz for Cardiac is 100. The values after 990 ((30+12)*25) are retained for respirtory .tsv files and after 3960 ((30+ 12)*100) are retained for cardiac .tsv files. Note, in some instances, there was a failure in collecting phyio data so physio files are not present. This occured for: 
	Sub-52 session 2, no resting state physio data
	sub-64 session 2, no resting state physio
	
	Discarded calibration volumes: the protocol included collection of calibration volumes for each DTI, Resting, Faces and MID run. For fMRI data, an additioaln 12 volumes were collected. For DTI data, an addition 6 volumes were collected. These have been removed from each .nii.gz file. So the final volumes for the fMRI data are, 600 = resting, 407 = MID, 723 = Faces, and final volumes for DTI are 102. For each data type collected, there is an AP-PA associated fieldmap. In some instance due to technical error these were not collected/provided.

Third, several participants have missing runs/folders. 
	Sub-18 session 2: does not have DTI/Resting state data since they arrived late to the scan. 
	Sub-26 session 1: does not have MID run 2 data as a result of an error.
	sub-32 session 1: missing DTI data due to technical error.
	Sub-36 session 2: missing resting state data due to error
	Sub-82 session 1: No DTI/resting state data, scan ended early due to participant headache


Fourth, there are several notable participant notes:
	Sub-101 session 1: participant mentioned taking acid the day before
	Sub-103 session 2: participant very particular about vision correction but could see screen. Left to use restroom before resting state scan
	Sub-98 session 1: participant *appeared* (session RA inspection of button box lights) to stop responding towards the end to all trials towards the end of MID run 2
	Sub-74 session 1: participant *appeared* (session RA inspection of button box lights) to not always respond during faces task 
	Sub-52 session 1: participant stopped hitting trigger during MID run 2
