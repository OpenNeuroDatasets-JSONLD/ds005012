## Data Notes
Converted with in-house mids2bids at University of Michigan

### Preprocessing notes:
- Discarded values for physio: Per Krisanne Litinas at the University of Michigan MRI lab, the MB fMRI protocol collects a 30-second buffer period plus 12 discarded volumes (9.6 seconds). So the physio files contained in each subject's ./func folder have the first 30 seconds (buffer period) + 9.6 (12 additional volumes for calibration) that are already discarded. Hence, the start time in physio files is zero. The calculation used: retained all values after ({30 secs physio buffer} + {9.6 secs calibration vols}) * {Hz}. For example, Hz for respiratory is 25 and Hz for Cardiac is 100. The values after 990 ((30+12)*25) are retained for respiratory .tsv files and after 3960 ((30+ 12)*100) are retained for cardiac .tsv files. Note, in some instances, there was a failure in collecting phyio data so physio files are not present. This occurred for:

- Discarded calibration volumes: the protocol included collection of calibration volumes for each MID run. For fMRI data, an additional 12 volumes were collected. These have been removed from each .nii.gz file, 407 = MID volumes. There is an AP-PA associated fieldmap for each run, in one instance this is missing due to technical error.

- Several participants have missing runs/folders.
  - Sub-66 session 1: missing fieldmap

- There are several notable participant notes:
  - Sub-103 session 2: participant very particular about vision correction but could see screen. Left to use restroom before resting state scan
  - Sub-98 session 1: participant *appeared* (session RA inspection of button box lights) to stop responding towards the end to all trials towards the end of MID run 2
